I'M A HAPPY PERSON WHO ENJOYS CONSERVING WITH PEOPLE WHO SHARE MY INTEREST. I APPRECIATE THE SIMPLICITY AND NOT ONE TO PROCRASTINATE ON TASKS.  I AM EASILY DEMOTIVATED, BUT I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO OVERCOME THAT TENDENCY. IT'S IS BECAUSE, IN ORDER TO LIVE A HAPPIER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE LIFE, I NEED TO OVERCOME ALL OF MY NEGATIVE CHARACTERISTIC.

AFTER THAT , I LIKE TO READING TO NOVELS. I, BUT MY FAVOURITE IS ANIME. I'M LIVING MY LIFE living . I AM GRATEFUL TO GOD FOR ALWAYS PROVIDING ME WITH CONVIENCE IN EVERYTHING I DO. MY family AND MY CLOSE FRIENDS ARE TOTALLY ENOUGH FOR ME . I DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE A TOXIC PEOPLE AROUND ME. DESPITE THE FACT THAT I HAVE MANY FRIENDS SINCE I WAS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL, I ONLY HAVE FEW CLOSE FRIENDS, BUT I'M TOTALLY HAPPY AND GRATEFUL TO HAVE THEM IN MY LIFE. I'M NOW GIVING IT ALL IN EVERYTHINGS THAT I CAN DO. SINCE I AM STILL IN UNIVERSITY, I WANT TO ACHIEVE AN EXCELLENT RESULTS SO THAT MY FAMILY CAN BE PROUD WITH ME.
